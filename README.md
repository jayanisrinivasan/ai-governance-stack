## 📝 Content Philosophy

This version reflects a more collaborative, bridge-building approach:
- Acknowledges political context without claiming false neutrality
- Focuses on gaps we can fill rather than criticizing existing approaches
- Emphasizes building with users, not for them
- Clear about values while maintaining infrastructure focus
